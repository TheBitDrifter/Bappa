## TODO

A foundational library for entity component system (ECS) game development and simulation, part of my personal project collection. Coming from a web development background, this is my playground for exploring game development concepts - expect frequent changes and experiments! While actively being worked on and far from stable, it serves as the backbone for my game development learning journey.

Documentation/Updates can eventually be found [here](https://dl43t3h5ccph3.cloudfront.net)(Domain subject to change, but will redirect).

Its is inspired heavily from:
